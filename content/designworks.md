As a generative designer, I code 3D with [`RhinoScriptSyntax`](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoScriptSyntax/) in Rhino. As an interaction designer and frontend engineer, I design application, prototype user interface, and deploy APPs on different devices. I am trying to do something interesting/funny/hopefully useful with XR (VR/AR).

# GBCamera - Nostalgia for GameBoy camera [<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up"></i>](#top)

<div style="padding:100% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1034998804?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="RPReplay_Final1733032674"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Pixel art lovers such as Nintendo Game Boy (GB) console users and photographers are interested in taking photos with the GB console+camera cartridge or upgrading the hardware (such as the camera lens and sensors) for better photography experiences. The mobile app is a pixel-art photograph tool enabling users to capture GB-like photos/videos. [[**source** <i class="fa-solid fa-code"></i>]](https://github.com/billbillbilly/final-project-poke) 

The Game Boy Camera is an accessory released by Nintendo in 1998 for the original Game Boy handheld console. With the low resolution and only four shades of grayscale, it became iconic in the retro gaming and pixel art communities. Although it was a novelty at the time, the Game Boy Camera has a cult following today. Now, both the GB series console and the cart have yet to be produced, which makes it unavailable for many followers. The devices and carts used in markets (such as eBay) are becoming expensive. The proposed project can provide users with an alternative and more fun experience, allowing users to adjust the focal length by taking the advance on cellphone cameras. In addition, users will be able to build up their GB photo albums and share photos with others.

This app aims to make it more convenient and economical for people to network with other plant lovers and get their favorite plants or offer their plants. This app allows people to post and share their wish lists and offer lists, and give the individuals with the right information based on the information of plants and other personal preferences. The app thus provides a map that displays all locations of community gardens and nurseries within the proximity of users.

When a single attractor curve is applied, two scenarios are depicted: one where the UV points are not relocated by the attractor, resulting in a regular 3D surface, and another where the UV points are adjusted according to the attractor curve, creating a deformed surface that follows the curve's contour. Similarly, with multiple attractor curves, a grid remains regular without relocation, leading to a uniform 3D surface. However, when the UV points are relocated based on the multiple attractor curves, the grid becomes more complex and irregular, resulting in a uniquely shaped 3D surface.

Initially, a triangle with a specified radius is set up. This triangle undergoes a series of recursive "crack" operations three times, progressively breaking down the shape into smaller triangles. Following this, a first branch is established, and the structure undergoes another series of recursive branching operations, also repeated three times. This recursive branching generates an intricate, multi-layered 3D form. The attractor surface and branches guide the shape's development, resulting in a detailed and complex geometric structure.

# Recompose [<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up"></i>](#top)
![](https://github.com/billbillbilly/generativeRhinoScript/blob/main/6_recompose/recompose.png?raw=true)

Transform an input surface into a complex 3D pipe structure through a series of geometric operations. It begins with an initial surface, from which surfaces are generated using a UV point matrix to create a grid pattern. These surfaces are then randomly scaled while preserving their slope, area, and vertices. Next, the scaled surfaces are relocated vertically based on their slope, and circles are created at the vertices, scaled according to the area and slope. Finally, these circles are connected to form a continuous 3D pipe structure that twists and turns, reflecting the characteristics of the original surface. This process demonstrates how an initial geometric shape can be transformed into a complex, intricate 3D form.

Simulate the movement of agents in a 3D space, where agents interact with each other and their environment, leaving trails behind them. The interactions include attracting or repelling agents based on their proximity, and detouring around obstacles represented by meshes.

As a shrinking city, the renewal of Detroit faces many challenges and problems like climate change, increasing vacancy and poverty, food insecurity, and soil contamination.

Climate change has both positive and negative impacts on the environment of Detroit. Increased temperature may increase the frequency and length of extreme heat events and heavy precipitation events. Those communities with less canopy coverage and of high-density population and imperviousness could suffer more from extreme weather. On the other hand, climate change will also bring some opportunities including longer growing seasons and more irrigation water.

This project proposed a phasing strategy using the vacant land and urban agriculture to provide a solution to these problems and make a more sustainable and resilient development for future Detroit.
