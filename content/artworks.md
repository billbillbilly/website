Coding art is fun. I got one self-motivated project (the first one) and several course-based projects.

# [Pop-upColor](https://billbillbilly.github.io/portfolio-content/)
`Pop-upColor` is an generative art project I started in 2021. Initially, I just played with celular autometa to create some interesting 3D patterns with Python in [Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/)

# Yo-yoCap
`Yo-yoCap` explores the enhancement of yo-yo performance art through the application of motion capture technology, aiming to create a more dynamic and interactive audio-visual spectacle. By utilizing 2D motion capture with [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and transmitting data to [MAX/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max) for processing, this research investigates how real-time tracking of yo-yo movements can alter background music and visualizations. The project involves analyzing key parameters such as yo-yo position and movement, and integrating these with an interactive system that responds to the performerâ€™s actions.

# fakeVR (This is a very funny project)
VR (virtual reality) has been a useful visual tool for designers, especially architecture people, to present and experience their 3D environment during the prototyping process and presentation. The human-centered experience provided by VR can give people a relatively realistic sense of 3D space and an isolated environment to explore space. However, most VR presentation options require a high-performance headset or computer with a fancy graphic card. `fakeVR` tries to provide a low-fi VR option (simulated VR experience) only using smartphones (inertial motion tracking) for prototype purposes.
