Coding art is fun. I got one self-motivated project (the first one) and several course-based projects.

# Pop-upColor 
![](https://billbillbilly.github.io/portfolio-content/images/ffffff_d400ff_04ff00.gif)

**Pop-upColor** is an generative art project I started in 2021. Initially, 
I just played with celular autometa to create some 3D patterns with Python in 
[Rhinoceros](https://www.rhino3d.com/). I thought it would be interesting to make 
a more interactive web application to customize and generate these patterns. 
So, I used [`Three.js`](https://threejs.org/) to write this project.

# Yo-yoCap

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/916828937?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="Yo-yoCap"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

**Yo-yoCap** explores the enhancement of yo-yo performance art through the application of motion capture technology, 
aiming to create a more dynamic and interactive audio-visual spectacle. By utilizing 2D motion capture with 
[OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and transmitting data to [MAX/MSP](https://cycling74.com/products/max) 
for processing, this research investigates how real-time tracking of yo-yo movements can alter background music 
and visualizations. The project involves analyzing key parameters such as yo-yo position and movement, 
and integrating these with an interactive system that responds to the performerâ€™s actions.

# spank2skate (It is cool and could be cooler)

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/916832247?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="spank2skate"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

Skateboarding is always cool. However, some people may be unable to enjoy playing it physically as well as others 
due to some limitations such as skills, age, disabilities, and even psychological fear. The concept of `spank2skate` 
is to embrace more people outside the skateboard community and let them have some fun.

# fakeVR (This is a very funny project) 

<div style="padding:56.25% 0 0 0;position:relative;"><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/916830568?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;" title="fakeVR"></iframe></div><script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

VR (virtual reality) has been a useful visual tool for designers, 
especially architecture people, to present and experience their 
3D environment during the prototyping process and presentation. 
The human-centered experience provided by VR can give people a 
relatively realistic sense of 3D space and an isolated environment 
to explore space. However, most VR presentation options require a 
high-performance headset or computer with a fancy graphic card. 
**fakeVR** tries to provide a low-fi VR option (simulated VR experience) 
only using smartphones (inertial motion tracking) for prototype purposes.
