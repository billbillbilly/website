# [Urban-Worm](https://github.com/billbillbilly/urbanworm)
![package](https://github.com/billbillbilly/urbanworm/blob/main/docs/images/urabn_worm_logo.png?raw=true)

Urban-Worm is a Python library that integrates remote sensing imagery, street view data, and vision-language models (VLMs) to assess urban units. Using APIs for data collection and VLMs for inference, Urban-Worm is designed to support the automation of the evaluation for urban environments, including roof integrity, structural condition, landscape quality, and urban perception.

# [gloBFPr](https://github.com/billbillbilly/gloBFPr)
![package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/billbillbilly/gloBFPr/2a9c0b002e8b87c3e15c5af1ce6c142a0095b462/logo.svg)

The gloBFPr package allows R users to search, download, and process global building footprint tiles with associated height information, derived from the 3D-GloBFP dataset published by Che et al. (2024, 2025). The data is hosted on Zenodo and covers global urban areas in shapefile format. The package will look to include more global Building Dataset in the future.

# [greenSD](https://github.com/billbillbilly/greenSD)
![package](https://github.com/billbillbilly/greenSD/blob/main/pkgdown/favicon/web-app-manifest-512x512.png?raw=true)

greenSD provides tools to access and analyze multi-band greenspace seasonality data cubes (available for 1,028 major global cities) and global land cover/NDVI data from the ESA WorldCover 10m Dataset. Users can download data using bounding boxes, city names, or coordinates, extract values at specific points, and filter by year or seasonal time window. Moreover, the package. The package also supports calculating human exposure to greenspace using a population-weighted greenspace exposure model based on Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) population data and computing a set of greenspace morphology metrics at patch or landscape levels.

# [streetscape](https://github.com/land-info-lab/streetscape)
![package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/land-info-lab/streetscape/main/images/streetscape_hex.png)

A collection of functions to search and download street view imagery  and to extract, quantify, and visualize visual features. Moreover, there are functions provided to generate Qualtrics survey in TXT format with street views.

# [quickPWCR](https://github.com/billbillbilly/quickPWCR)
![package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/billbillbilly/quickPWCR/main/quickpwcr_hex.png)

A collection of functions for constructing large pairwise comparisons and rating them using the Elo rating system with supporting parallel processing. The method of random sample pairs is based on Reservoir Sampling.

# [viewscape](https://github.com/land-info-lab/viewscape)
![package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/land-info-lab/viewscape/294ce6848e4dbeb4572b157b20455141613c4a00/viewscape_hex-01.png)

Viewshed-based viewscape analysis supports a range of scientific domains, including urban planning and ecosystem service research, focusing on enhancing well-being benefits. However, most viewshed tools and applications are proprietary and may not be accessible to all. Here, we introduce the open-source R package viewscape created for reproducible calculations of visual landscape metrics within the R environment.

# [dsmSearch](https://github.com/land-info-lab/dsmSearch)
![package](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/land-info-lab/dsmSearch/master/dsmsearch_hex-02.png)

The package dsmSearch offers functions for retrieving high-resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, providing a toolkit to collect remote sensing data effectively for research and analysis in fields such as ecology, geography, urban planning, and forestry.
