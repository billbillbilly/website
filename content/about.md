This is Xiaohao Yang's website. I built it with [`blogdown`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/). I usually fill (ruin) my schedule with my interests. Deadline always help me focus on priority.
- I am a big fan of [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)!
- I am a coder of [design](/designworks/), [art](/artworks/), [games](/games/), and [tools](/tools/).
- I am a [researcher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=7gBKKAUAAAAJ) on soundscape and landscape at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.
- I am trying to do everything I think is interesting even if I know I can't.
