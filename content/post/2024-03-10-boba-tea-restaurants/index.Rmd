# 1 Introduction

Babo tea - "波霸奶茶" in Chinese (also known as pearl milk tea or bubble milk tea) - 
with its origins in Taiwan, holds particular appeal among customers interested in 
Asian cuisines and cultural experiences. Enjoying boba tea while waiting for 
a table at a restaurant or as a delightful treat after dining is a widespread 
practice in urban areas like Los Angeles, CA. Boba-tea shops and restaurants 
often serve as complementary businesses. Customers who visit a restaurant for 
a meal might seek a boba-tea shop nearby for a refreshing beverage afterward, 
or vice versa. This symbiotic relationship enhances the overall dining and 
leisure experience for customers, encouraging a culture of "meal followed 
by a treat." By strategically positioning these establishments near one another, 
business owners can capitalize on cross-promotion opportunities and drive 
increased foot traffic.

# 2 Research Question and Methods  

## Questions:
The study aims to understand this symbiotic relationship by investigating
the linkage between operating conditions and the spatial connection between
boba-tea shops and restaurants within urban areas, specifically focusing on
how their proximity influences business opportunities in Monterey Park and
Alhambra, California.

The study answered two questions:

* If boba-tea shops are more likely located within the 10-minute walking
distance of restaurants?
* How are the degree and edge weight of spatial network between boba-tea
shops and restaurants associated with their operating conditions within
the 10-minute walking distance between them?

## Method:
To understand the complementary businesses between boba-tea shops and restaurants
based on spatial analysis, the point of interest (POI) sourced from Yelp API was
utilized to conduct spatial data analysis. I assumed the greater rate and more
review count of a boba-tea shop or a restaurant may indicate better operating conditions.

For data collection, a grid-based approach was adopted to systematically search
for POIs of boba-tea shop and restaurant within the study area.
In this data acquisition, the id, coordinates, rate, and review count fields of
POI data were extracted for data analysis.

The analysis phase involved linear regression and network analysis methods to
investigate the relationship between operating conditions (rate and review) and
network metrics (degree and edge weight), and identify patterns of spatial 
connectivity within the network.

# 3 Data Acquisition
Polygons of city boundary of Montery Park and Alhambra were downloaded from
the US Census and merged for creating search girds.

A set of grids was created based on the bounding box of the study area.
Within each grid, bthe oba tea shop and restaurant POIs were collected
using the centroid and diagonal line of the grid as the location and radius,
with "boba tea" and "restaurants" as key words. As a result, 539 restaurants
and 112 boba-tea shops were collected.

```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
MP_poly <- sf::read_sf("/Users/yangxiaohao/Downloads/Lab_UInform/assignment1/ploygons/MP_poly.shp")
A_poly <- sf::read_sf("/Users/yangxiaohao/Downloads/Lab_UInform/assignment1/ploygons/A_poly.shp")
place_poly <- sf::read_sf("/Users/yangxiaohao/Downloads/Lab_UInform/assignment1/ploygons/place_poly.shp")
# create grids for searching Yelp POIs
place_grid <- sf::st_make_grid(
  place_poly,
  n=c(10,10),
  crs = sf::st_crs(place_poly)
)
place_grid <- sf::st_intersection(place_grid, place_poly)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
plot(place_poly$geometry)
plot(MP_poly$geometry, add = T)
plot(A_poly$geometry, add = T)
plot(place_grid, add = T)
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
restaurant <- read.csv("/Users/yangxiaohao/Downloads/Lab_UInform/assignment1/restaurant.csv")
boba_shops <- read.csv("/Users/yangxiaohao/Downloads/Lab_UInform/assignment1/boba_shops.csv")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(restaurant)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(boba_shops)
```

# 4 Data Analysis and Interpretation
###Edge Document Creation:
The first step involves generating an "edge" document to represent potential
customer pathways between restaurants and boba tea shops. This is achieved using
the expand.grid function, which creates all possible combinations of restaurant
and boba tea shop IDs. These combinations symbolize hypothetical connections or
routes customers might take from a restaurant to a boba tea shop and vice versa.

### Augmenting Edge Document:
The edge document is then enriched with the ratings (rate) and the number of reviews
(review) for both restaurants and boba tea shops. This is done by joining the edge
document with subsets of the restaurant and boba tea shop data frames, respectively.
The resulting edge document contains comprehensive information about each potential
pathway, including identifiers for the establishments and metrics indicating their
operating conditions: popularity and customer satisfaction.

### Node Document Creation:
Subsequently, a "node" document is created by merging the data frames of restaurants
and boba tea shops into a single dataset. A new attribute, type, is introduced to
distinguish between the two kinds of establishments within the unified dataset.
This classification facilitates further analysis and visualization by providing
a straightforward way to differentiate between restaurants and boba tea shops.

### Spatial Transformation:
The node dataset undergoes a transformation to a spatial format (sf object) to enable
geographic analysis and mapping. Each node, representing either a boba tea shop or
a restaurant, is assigned spatial coordinates (x, y). These coordinates are then
transformed to a specific spatial reference system (SRS) for consistency and accuracy
in spatial operations.

### Edge Geometry and Weight Assignment:
The connections between nodes are spatialized through the creation of edge geometries,
converting abstract connections into spatial lines. The lengths of these lines, representing
walking distances, are calculated and used to assign weights to each edge. Edges exceeding
800 m (beyond a 10-minute walking distance) are excluded from the dataset. In addition,
Min-max normalization was employed to rescale the weights with the range from 0 to 1.

### Node Degree and Weight Metrics:
For each node, the degree (the number of connections it has with other nodes) is computed.
This metric provides insight into the node's centrality within the network. Additionally,
the average and minimum weights (distances) of the edges connected to each node are calculated.
These metrics help in understanding the accessibility of each establishment and the spatial
distribution of boba tea shops and restaurants relative to each other.

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
nodeSpatial <- sf::read_sf("/Users/yangxiaohao/Downloads/Lab_UInform/assignment1/data/nodeSpatial.dbf")
edge2line <- sf::read_sf("/Users/yangxiaohao/Downloads/Lab_UInform/assignment1/data/edge2line.dbf")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(nodeSpatial) 
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
head(edge2line) 
```

### Descriptive analysis:
the mean values of 'rate', 'degree', and 'review' of boba-tea shops and restaurants were
compared using a bar chart plot.
1. Both boba tea shops and restaurants generally have good ratings, with boba tea shops
showing slightly higher average ratings than restaurants.
2. Boba tea shops have a significantly higher average number of reviews compared to restaurants,
suggesting that boba-tea shops may receive more traffic or may have been established for
longer periods, thus accumulating more reviews over time.
3. The number of connections to each other in a network, is higher on average for
boba-tea shops than restaurants, indicating that boba-tea shops may located within
the intersected accessible areas of several restaurant.

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
plot_data <- function(data, info) {
  if (info == 'rate') {
    bilan <- aggregate(rate~type , data=data , mean)
    stdev <- aggregate(rate~type , data=data , sd)
  } else if (info == 'degree') {
    bilan <- aggregate(degree~type , data=data , mean)
    stdev <- aggregate(degree~type , data=data , sd)
  } else if (info == 'review') {
    bilan <- aggregate(review~type , data=data , mean)
    stdev <- aggregate(review~type , data=data , sd)
  }
  rownames(bilan) <- bilan[,1]
  bilan <- as.matrix(bilan[,-1])
  # Plot boundaries
  lim <- 1.2*max(bilan)
  # A function to add arrows on the chart
  error.bar <- function(x, y, upper, lower=upper, length=0.1,...){
    arrows(x,y+upper, x, y-lower, angle=90, code=3, length=length, ...)
  }
  # calculate the standard deviation for each specie and condition:
  rownames(stdev) <- stdev[,1]
  stdev <- as.matrix(stdev[,-1]) * 1.96 / 10
  # add the error bar on the plot using my "error bar" function
  out_barplot <- barplot(bilan, beside=T, legend.text=T,
                         col=c(rgb(0.3,0.1,0.4,0.6),
                               rgb(0.3,0.9,0.4,0.6)),
                         ylim=c(0,lim), ylab=info)
  error.bar(out_barplot, bilan, stdev)
  legend("topright", legend=c("Boba-tea shop", "Restaurant"),
         fill=c(rgb(0.3,0.1,0.4,0.6), rgb(0.3,0.9,0.4,0.6)))
}
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
par(mfrow = c(1, 3))
# mean of rate of restaurants and shops
plot_data(nodeSpatial, 'rate')
# mean  of node degree of restaurants and shops
plot_data(nodeSpatial, 'review')
# mean of node degree of restaurants and shops
plot_data(nodeSpatial, 'degree')
```

### Regression analysis:

```{r include=FALSE}
model1 <- lm(review ~ degree + min_wght + men_wght,
             data=nodeSpatial)

model2 <- lm(rate ~ degree + min_wght + men_wght,
             data=nodeSpatial)
```

Regression analysis was conducted to investigate the impact of the establishment's network
degree andaverage/minimum walking distance (min_weight and mean_weight) on its rating and
number of reviews. Two linear regression models are specified:

- Model 1 examines the relationship between the number of reviews (review) and the explanatory
variables (degree, min_weight, and mean_weight). This model aims to understand how these
factors associate the number of reviews. The model suggests that the minimum and average walking distances significantly associate with the number of reviews for boba tea shops and restaurants, with the degree of network connectivity showing a non-significant effect. The minimum distance is positively associated with review number, whereas the average distance is negatively associated with review number. However, the overall explanatory power of the model is quite low, indicating that other unmeasured factors may be influencing customer reviews.

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(model1)
```

- Model 2 explores how the same set of explanatory variables associates the customer
rating (rate). This model indicates that the degree of network connectivity significantly and positively associate with the ratings of boba tea shops and restaurants, with minimal and non-significant impacts from minimum and average walking distances. However, as with the previous model on reviews, the overall explanatory power of the model is low, suggesting that other factors not included in this model might play a significant role in determining ratings.

```{r echo=FALSE}
summary(model2)
```

# 5 Data Visualization and Interpretation

First, the road data was downloaded from OSM to be served as the map's background.
The road lines are transformed to match the coordinate reference system (CRS) of
the study area. They are also clipped to ensure they only cover the study area.
Maps displaying the spatial network of boba-tea shops and restaurants were constructed,
visualizing attributes (e.g., degree, review, rate). 

### Map 1

For the map as below, a boba-tea shop may serve customers from multiple nearby restaurant ([Fig 1](#babo-fig-1)). This implies that boba-tea shops are pivotal nodes, facilitating a broader network of connections within their accessible vicinity than restaurants do with neighboring boba-tea establishments.

### Map 2

Most boba-tea shops are located in the area, where they can connect more restaurants with more review counts ([Fig 2](#babo-fig-2)).
The map can be a strategic asset, highlighting potential areas for establishing new business to tap into existing popularity and foot traffic patterns. It may also assist current business owners in understanding their positioning within the local market based on consumer feedback volumes.

### Map 3

Both highly-rated and lower-rated businesses are scattered throughout the area, without a clear pattern of ratings clustering ([Fig 3](#babo-fig-3)). For boba-tea shops and restaurants, factors other than location play a significant role in promoting their business.
