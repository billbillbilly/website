COVID-19 is an international disaster that has negative influences on people's work and life. Many Twitter users shared their own feelings and thoughts about COVID-19 in tweets, which actually provides a different dimension to understand how this outbreak goes in people's minds and to visualize this map in people's subjective consciousness. This study focuses on analyzing how many times countries or regions in the world were mentioned by Twitter users in their tweets and analyzing the sentiment of these COVID-19 related tweets. The name of country and region was used as the statistical keyword. The sentiments dataset is a general-purpose lexicon bing from Bing Liu and collaborators.

Taking the parks in Guangahou's core urban areas as the research object. The study area includes four main districts of Guangzhou, and 68 city parks with 1 hectares or more are selected as study objects. The frequency of park visits is described by Micro-blog check-in data, which include individuals coordinate info. So, the points within areas of the study parka can indicate the location of every visitor in the parks. The more points are in parks, the higher frequency of visits the park.

Based on the traditional reclamation agricultural model, our proposal is to integrate agriculture production with wetland transformation under sea-level rise to create a successional salty agriculture landscape adapting to coastal environmental change and benefit agriculture, ecology, and social culture for the next 100 years.

# From Risk to Resilience: Assessment and Strategy of Complex Urban System Future Sea-level Rise in Guangzhou [2019 IFLA Asia-Pac Professional Award of Excellence] [<i class="fa-solid fa-turn-up"></i>](#top)
![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/3d9996_7232d562ae33403f861d7089b03e0bf4~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_1856,h_1434,al_c,q_95,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/01-01.png)

Based on the feature scenarios of sea level rise and the PSR (Preasure-State-Response) model, the vulnerability of various systems in the coastal area of Guangzhou was evaluated. The proposed landscape planning guidance aims to enhance the resilience and ecological services of the coastal systems.
