      <description>LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) or point cloud data is useful when we are conducting high-resolution spatial analysis such as viewshed/viewscape, watershed runoff, and other analysis based on digital surface/terrain models. But collecting LiDAR data may challenge for data download and storage because the data is huge even for a median-scale area like a city. Converting a large amount of point cloud into a raster for spatial analysis could be even more computationally expensive.</description>

      <title>viewscape in R</title>

      <description>This is an integrated tutorial about viewscape and dsmSearch. These two packages were initially one before getting published because I thought it would be cool if one can just specify a geographical area without DSM/DEM to compute a viewshed(s). This has been explained the purpose of making the dsmSearch, which was two functions for searching and downloading point cloud data via API.&#xA;Of course, viewscape is not designed for just computing the viewshed even if this is the core of the package.</description>
