      <description>The initial idea of building a personal website is just showcasing some of my works from design studios, I used to directly craft my HTML5 website without any framework and then handle my portfolio on platforms that provide cloud-based web development services. As I got more projects done recently, I became increasingly lazy to update my portfolio website and the price for using the cloud-based web services is incredibly expensive. So, I was looking for a more interesting way to organize my staffs.</description>

      <description>This is an integrated tutorial about viewscape and dsmSearch. These two packages were initially one before getting published because I thought it would be cool if one can just specify a geographical area without DSM/DEM to compute a viewshed(s). This has been explained the purpose of making the dsmSearch, which was two functions for searching and downloading point cloud data via API.&#xA;Of course, viewscape is not designed for computing the viewshed even if this is the core of the package.</description>

      <description>[Me] [News] [Publications] [Resume] [This Website] [Contact]&#xA;[Me] I am a big fan of R and cellular automata! I am a coder [] of design , art , games , and R tools (viewscape and dsmSearch). I am trying to do everything I think is interesting even if I know I can&amp;rsquo;t. My education background is initially rooted in landscape architecture (7 years) and now overlaps with Data Sciense and Human-computer Interaction (since 2019).</description>

      <description>Coding art is fun. I got one self-motivated project (the first one) and several course-based projects.&#xA;Pop-upColor Pop-upColor is an generative art project I started in 2021. Initially, I just played with celular autometa to create some interesting 3D patterns with Python in Rhinoceros. [] []&#xA;Yo-yoCap Yo-yoCap explores the enhancement of yo-yo performance art through the application of motion capture technology, aiming to create a more dynamic and interactive audio-visual spectacle.</description>

      <description>Maybe I would do some games in R one day. I coded 3D with RhinoScriptSyntax in Python.&#xA;randomStairBranch This is a simple script developed with RhinoScriptSyntax. A simple agent method integrated with random walk was implemented.&#xA;terrain This script enable generating 3D terrain with interaction in Rhino.</description>

      <description>I like video games (PC/XBOX/SWITCH/Mobile games&amp;hellip;) and have spent a lot of time on it. I almost get rid of PC games after I switched to Mac from Windows. Thanks to Mac&amp;rsquo;s graphic card. Now, I am working on a game series called SillySimilation.&#xA;SillySimilation There are three games in the SillySimilation series. Each of them tells a story about survival. The environment has been extremely simplified and accelerated in games.</description>

      <description>I make either useful or useless tools for research (fun)&#xA;viewscape Viewshed-based viewscape analysis supports a range of scientific domains, including urban planning and ecosystem service research, focusing on enhancing well-being benefits. However, most viewshed tools and applications are proprietary and may not be accessible to all. Here, we introduce the open-source R package viewscape created for reproducible calculations of visual landscape metrics within the R environment.&#xA;dsmSearch The package dsmSearch offers functions for retrieving high-resolution Digital Surface Models (DSM) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, providing a toolkit to collect remote sensing data effectively for research and analysis in fields such as ecology, geography, urban planning, and forestry.</description>
